# Lab 6
### Structure/Guide

*Please Read Before Continuing:* The Starter Kit is not a shortcut to a complete lab. The purpose of the Starter Kit is to provide a framework for you to get started on your path to learning - it is not a replacement for building your own project. The intention here is to give you something to reference when you feel lost. 

*Note:* If you do use the Starter Kit as the foundation for your Lab submission and did not attend the classes which explained how it works, you are using it at your own risk.

*Note:* The requirements for Lab 6 state that you should not use build tools, or a compiler, however, because we are removing Lab 7 as a requirement, the 
Starter Kit will cover a few Lab 7 topics to ensure that we are able to learn some of those key concepts.
